### Strategy

#### People over the age of 45:

1. I would like to have place in the internet when i can find meal recipes as a plain text, not video, i cannot cook and watch. I prefer to read the recipe. The first view of page? - I want to see there good ideas for a dinner. Ingredients must be shown definitevly in piece, spoons and glasses, weight is good for people who is on a diet. I like to eat well.
2.  I still have my notebook with recipes - i like to look in to the piece of paper during cooking. Printing the recipe from web it could be a good feature. I could share my notebook, if inserting recipes will be easy i could put my recipes to web by myself.
3. Pictures are not really necessary if the title and description is good.
